  <h4 class="body-text">Hi there. I'm Chris and I am enrolled in the Full Stack
  Developer Program at Thinkful. I have worked in Digital Marketing for over 13
  years for various companies, including Target and Regis Corporation. 
  I decided to pivot to become a developer of digital things rather than 
  just a user of them. My ideal employment scenario is on a team of talented programmers
  who strive to create quality work experiences for themselves and their clients.<br> 
  Outside of the office, I enjoy playing guitar (poorly, thus privately), nature
  walks, and grilling. I often get compliments that my grilled creations are best described as “edible”.</h4>

<h4 class="body-text"><span class = "projdesc">Project Title:</span> HR Company Policy Quiz<br>
  <span class = "projdesc">Project Description:</span> I developed an app that would help a Human Resources 
  department administer an on-boarding/orientation quiz for new employees. The goal of the quiz would be to confirm
  new employees are familiar with the company policies handbook in order to avoid accidental policy violations.
  The app is an interactive multiple-choice onboarding quiz that provides different feedback for
  correct vs. incorrect answers, tracks the question the user is on as well as their current score, 
  and provides final feedback that varies based on the final score achieved (pass, near-pass and fail feedback).<br>

<h4 class="body-text"><span class = "projdesc">Project Title:</span> Local Weather and Restaurants App<br>
  <span class = "projdesc">Project Description:</span> My weather and restaurant app is designed to be a simple tool
   that helps a user plan two key componenets of their day: Weather information for planning outfits and/or things to bring
    with them (i.e. an umbrella if the forecast calls for rain) and where to eat once they get to their destination. A user 
    just has to input a valid zip code to see the weather for said zip code, as well as a list of nearby restaurants, including
   their respective websites so they can view the menu, find address information, and potentially order food online.
   Additional features include a help button that alerts a user on how to use the app, zip code verification (if an invalid
   zip code is entered an alert appears), and New Search buttons included above and below the fold so a user does not need
   to scroll back to the top of the page if they would like to do a new search.
