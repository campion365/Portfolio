<section id = "bio-home"> <h3>BIO</h3>
  <h4 class="body-text">Hi there. I'm Chris and I am enrolled in the Full Stack
  Developer Program at Thinkful. I have worked in Digital Marketing for over 13
  years for various companies, including Target and Regis Corporation. 
  I decided to pivot to become a developer of digital things rather than 
  just a user of them. My ideal employment scenario is on a team of talented programmers
  who strive to create quality work experiences for themselves and their clients.<br> 
  Outside of the office, I enjoy playing guitar (poorly, thus privately), nature
  walks, and grilling. I often get compliments that my grilled creations are best described as “edible”.</h4>

<h4 class="body-text"><span class = "projdesc">Project Title:</span> HR Company Policy Quiz<br>
  <span class = "projdesc">Project Description:</span> I developed an app that would help a Human Resources 
  department administer an on-boarding/orientation quiz for new employees. The goal of the quiz would be to confirm
  new employees are familiar with the company policies handbook in order to avoid accidental policy violations.
  The app is an interactive multiple-choice onboarding quiz that provides different feedback for
  correct vs. incorrect answers, tracks the question the user is on as well as their current score, 
  and provides final feedback that varies based on the final score achieved (pass, near-pass and fail feedback).<br> 
  <span class = "projdesc">Technologies Used:</span> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery<br>
  <span class = "projdesc">Link to App:</span> <a href="https://campion365.github.io/InteractiveWebAppsQuiz" target="_blank">GitHub Live Quiz</a><br>
